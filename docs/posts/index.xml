      <description>This blog post series&amp;rsquo; goal is to provide a comprehensive list of tools I use and how to set them up.
When I first started programming, I was so curious to try the coolest gadgets and try new editors, window managers, and programming languages. This blog postâ€™s goal is to try to share as much information that I have with you, either a complete beginner, looking to increase your productivity and to make your stuff look really cool, or an experienced developer looking to add a few tools to your arsenal.</description>

      <description>I finally have my own hosted blog! Picking a good enough Hugo theme was so incredibly difficult, but at least for right now, I picked the hugo-zen theme. There were a few issues I found with it so I modified it a bunch. But as a foundation, I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be very good.
I wanted to add my own flavor to it so I added a glitch art image and changed the coloring a bit to match it.</description>
