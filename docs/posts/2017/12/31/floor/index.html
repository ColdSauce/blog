				<p>Iâ€™ve been sleeping on the floor for the past 3 months, it has been nothing short of amazing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/floor_setup.png" alt="Floor setup" /></p>

<p>When I moved to my new room in San Francisco, I found out the previous tenant never took their mattress with them. They left it there for some reason. I needed a bed so I bought some queen sized bed sheets and a pillow that I put on the mattress lying on my floor. I started noticing problems with the mattress early on. My entire body would sink into it and that lead to discomfort in the morning.</p>

<p>Sleeping on the floor happened completely by accident. I talked to my friend Tejas about the wonders of sleeping on the floor at a conference in San Francisco. He talked to me about the health benefits of sleeping on the floor. I was a bit hesitant at first but after researching a bit online, I started to learn more about the benefits provided. I didnâ€™t have any space to sleep on the floor since the queen sized mattress was taking up a lot of room and throwing it out was too risky. A
month into living in the new space, I learned of amazing news from my roommate. He told me that the previous tenant wanted their mattress back. It was a bit weird to me at first but I just went with it. Movers came in the next day and took the mattress from my house.</p>

<p>I now had three options.</p>

<p>I could use an air mattress my roommates had, for the next three months I would stay in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I could buy a new mattress on Amazon for a relatively low price of $100.</p>

<p>I could sleep on the floor.</p>

<p>I thought about these options for a bit, but decided that the coolest experience would be to sleep on the floor.</p>

<p>I have recently developed a mental model of how to assess situations and how to decide what to do. I am viewing life as a really awesome and fun game. What are the things I could do to level up? It seems a bit arbitrary on the outside but itâ€™s meaningful to me. I figured out that sleeping on the floor would be a totally new, awesome experience, whereas the other two options sounded really boring.</p>

<p>I put a thin blanket I bought, on the floor so that I could sleep on something more smooth than my carpet, put my pillow on it, and lied down.</p>

<p>The first three days of sleeping on the floor were the worst nights of sleep Iâ€™ve ever had while sleeping in my own room. I would wake up in the middle of the night, my hips hurting, feeling awful. I couldnâ€™t wait for the morning to come so I could escape the floor.</p>

<p>Something weird happened on the fourth day. I felt completely fine. It was the first night that I slept without waking up in the middle of the night.</p>

<dl>
<dt>After three months, I can confidently say that I havenâ€™t had this good of sleep in a long time. Every morning, I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day in front of me.</dt>
