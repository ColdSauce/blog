				<p>Answering specific questions is so limiting that when someone asks me to take part in answering a question they ask, I refuse. Usually, this would make a person anti-social, and make them lose all their friends. However, I&rsquo;ve devised a system that works really well to avoid answering specific questions that don&rsquo;t have a lot of practicality for anything other than their own domain.</p>

<p>Instead of answering a specific question, I like to try to abstract away the specificity and go for the root of the question. That way, if I really do need to answer the specific question because of the context, I can, but I&rsquo;ll have the more general answer in my head to use later on.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently asked me &ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t going to work for the company you&rsquo;re going to work at now, where would you go work?&rdquo; To abstract away the specificity of this question, I thought about <em>why</em> I work. <em>Why</em> I choose companies, <em>why</em> I choose specific opportunities. This lead me to learn more about myself and allowed me to use those principles that I learned from self-reflection to answer that question. Instead of just answering that question, though, I was internally answering more general questions about myself, who I am, and why I do what I do. I was also able to answer a follow-up question about investing money vs investing time without much thought. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;d already answered the more general question from earlier.</p>

<p>This idea of abstracting away specificity has also helped me be more creative. When at a hackerspace in Shanghai, I met a person working on a self-moving plant pot that moves where there is more sunlight, and waters itself. When trying to help him brainstorm new ideas, I chose to think of otherwise immobile living organism and how to make them mobile and more human-like. Things I came up with were having your fish have a Twitter account, having a sensor next to a turtle&rsquo;s stomach and having a scream play incredibly loudly from a speaker next to its mouth when the turtle was hungry, IoT hamster wheel and an online hamsters olympics, something that measures how happy/sad your dog is and play music according to its mood, etc.</p>

<p>Speaking of ideas, I&rsquo;ve changed my view on how I think about ideas. I now default to the craziest, most out there idea when proposing anything. For example, another time I was in Shanghai I was freezing. It was so cold. My god. I told some people  at the hackerspace that I want to make a warm, non-toxic liquid that could warm your blood and make you feel warmer. When I pitched the same idea in San Francisco, a friend of mine said &ldquo;why not just stop the neurotransmitter that tells you how cold you are, from working.&rdquo; I thought that was genius. Then I learned from another friend that doing something like that could cause the body to develop a tolerance to that drug which could then cause withdrawl symptoms of being incredibly cold all the time. That idea is definitely off the table.</p>

<p>Two rules of thumb for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generalize a question to find very interesting unique answers</li>
<li>Think of the craziest most far out ideas even if you have no idea that they&rsquo;ll work</li>
</ul>

<p>The second point reminds me a bit of the idea of the Beginner&rsquo;s Mind. Naivety is the key to all true innovation, in my opinion. Having that beginner&rsquo;s mind makes you think in ways that nobody in the field/industry ever thought which is a huge advantage in coming up with somethings others have disregarded as impractical or otherwise irrelevant. I&rsquo;m going to write a blog post about this sometime coming up because it&rsquo;s something I deeply believe in.</p>

<p>I would love to talk more about ideas. I know the hit thing these days is &ldquo;ideas are worthless, execution is what matters&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m a super curious person that likes prototyping on stuff. So if you want to brainstorm, I am always, always down. Hopefully we can use these techniques for both of us to have an interesting conversation.</p>
