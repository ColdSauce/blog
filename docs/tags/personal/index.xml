      <description>2017 was a year of good people and amazing adventures.
Nan Lian Garden, Hong Kong
January
I woke up a sleeping security guard at the airport in Beijing, telling her that I have to get to my gate as I had a flight to Hong Kong in 12 hours. She was startled and told me that Hainan airlines will give me a free hotel. I was confused since I thought I needed a visa to leave the Beijing airport but I just went with the flow.</description>

      <description>If you talked to me at a party any time in the past couple of months — you know exactly what questions I asked you.
“What is your biggest fear?”
“Why do you want to be successful?”
“What does success mean to you?”
“Where does your motivation come from?”
I asked these questions because I was asking myself them and didn’t have the answers that would satisfy me.
Over the past year, I have been struggling trying to figure out who I am and what I’m supposed to do.</description>

      <description>If you know me, you know I’m a huge fan of Dragonball. Be it the original, Dragonball Z, Dragonball GT (yes, I said it!), or DragonBall Super. I have been thinking a lot about my life and how I got where I am today. The thing that always comes back is the Goku effect.
What is the Goku effect? Quite simply — always work as hard as you can to be the best.</description>
