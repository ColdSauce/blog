      <description>I recently started live streaming my studying using Mac and Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)
In this blog post, I want to talk about how I use OBS and other tools to create an effective and engaging live streaming experience.
Live streaming your computer screen has historically had a gaming connotation. Because of this, most streaming tools have been focused on the Windows operating system. This has left a giant void in support of Mac and Linux.</description>

      <description>Answering specific questions is so limiting that when someone asks me to take part in answering a question they ask, I refuse. Usually, this would make a person anti-social, and make them lose all their friends. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve devised a system that works really well to avoid answering specific questions that don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of practicality for anything other than their own domain.
Instead of answering a specific question, I like to try to abstract away the specificity and go for the root of the question.</description>
