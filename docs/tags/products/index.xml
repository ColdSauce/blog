      <description>*Disclaimer: this blog post is geared heavily towards web products. If you would like to learn about Android or iOS prototyping, or some other kind of prototyping, this is not the blog post for you. Also â€” this blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a blog post on being a good engineer.*
I have spent the last year and a half dedicating as much time as I can on learning how to build products as quickly as possible.</description>
