      <description>My sleep has been absolutely terrible for the past week. Stress had something to do with it, but I thought there must have been something more. Iâ€™ve been stressed before, and never had this bad sleep. I recalled a video of a psychological test I had seen a number of years ago. People would go into a room with a bed, and fall asleep with sensors attached to their heads. When the sensors would detect that the person went into REM sleep, the stage of sleep where a person dreams, there would be a speaker that played a short, but very loud sound.</description>
