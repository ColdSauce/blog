      <description>I finally have my own hosted blog! Picking a good enough Hugo theme was so incredibly difficult, but at least for right now, I picked the hugo-zen theme. There were a few issues I found with it so I modified it a bunch. But as a foundation, I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be very good.
I wanted to add my own flavor to it so I added a glitch art image and changed the coloring a bit to match it.</description>
