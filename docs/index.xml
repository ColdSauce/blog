      <description>This blog post series&amp;rsquo; goal is to provide a comprehensive list of tools I use and how to set them up.
When I first started programming, I was so curious to try the coolest gadgets and try new editors, window managers, and programming languages. This blog post‚Äôs goal is to try to share as much information that I have with you, either a complete beginner, looking to increase your productivity and to make your stuff look really cool, or an experienced developer looking to add a few tools to your arsenal.</description>

      <description>I finally have my own hosted blog! Picking a good enough Hugo theme was so incredibly difficult, but at least for right now, I picked the hugo-zen theme. There were a few issues I found with it so I modified it a bunch. But as a foundation, I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be very good.
I wanted to add my own flavor to it so I added a glitch art image and changed the coloring a bit to match it.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been sleeping on the floor for the past 3 months, it has been nothing short of amazing.
When I moved to my new room in San Francisco, I found out the previous tenant never took their mattress with them. They left it there for some reason. I needed a bed so I bought some queen sized bed sheets and a pillow that I put on the mattress lying on my floor.</description>

      <description>2017 was a year of good people and amazing adventures.
Nan Lian Garden, Hong Kong
January
I woke up a sleeping security guard at the airport in Beijing, telling her that I have to get to my gate as I had a flight to Hong Kong in 12 hours. She was startled and told me that Hainan airlines will give me a free hotel. I was confused since I thought I needed a visa to leave the Beijing airport but I just went with the flow.</description>

      <description>I had a fantastic day and wanted to write about it.
My friend Jeron came to SF to hang out for the weekend. I woke up, got ready for the day, and got a text message from my roommate, Dan, asking if we want to get brunch. I don‚Äôt know why he even asks me anymore when I always say yes. I was so excited and hungry. I called my friend Changbai to ask if he wanted to join us at The Grove in Hayes Valley.</description>

      <description>If you talked to me at a party any time in the past couple of months‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou know exactly what questions I asked you.
‚ÄúWhat is your biggest fear?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy do you want to be successful?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat does success mean to you?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere does your motivation come from?‚Äù
I asked these questions because I was asking myself them and didn‚Äôt have the answers that would satisfy me.
Over the past year, I have been struggling trying to figure out who I am and what I‚Äôm supposed to do.</description>

      <title>URL Shorteners as a Data Store</title>

      <description>Because why not?
GitHub repo
In this blog post, I‚Äôm going to be talking about a proof of concept I created for a way to store data in any URL shortening service on the internet.
I have been thinking of paradigms revolving around data. How data is stored, how it‚Äôs transfered, and how it‚Äôs consumed. I tried to do a couple of experiments in the storage aspect to see if I could come up with some new cool way of storing data.</description>

      <description>I wrote this blog post about a year ago but finally got a chance to publish it.
How many¬†::‚Äôs does it take to screw in a light-bulb? A car‚Äôs worth.¬†I‚Äôm currently in a class where we are using Scheme extensively. This has made me very used to the idea of structuring my algorithms using car and cdr for any sort of data manipulation.¬†car returns the head of a List while cdr returns the tail of List.</description>

      <title>Quick Serbian Lesson‚Ää‚Äî Kako Da Ne</title>
      <link>https://blog.stefanaleksic.com/posts/2016/11/01/kako_da_ne/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.stefanaleksic.com/posts/2016/11/01/kako_da_ne/</guid>
      <description>Why do so many Serbian people keep on saying ‚ÄúHow yes no‚Äù in regular conversation?
When trying to translate ‚Äúkako da ne‚Äù into English, Google picks it up as Croatian and gives the incorrect translation of ‚Äúhow yes no.‚Äù
–ö–∞–∫–æ –¥–∞ –Ω–µ.
This translates to two completely different phrases given a different tone.
When used in a sarcastic way, it means ‚Äúyeah, ok‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah, right.‚Äù Used in a non sarcastic tone it means ‚Äúof course‚Äù which might be a bit strange at first to someone learning Serbian.</description>

      <title>Slavic Antithesis</title>
      <link>https://blog.stefanaleksic.com/posts/2016/11/01/antithesis/</link>

      <description>Look up in the sky! It‚Äôs a bird! It‚Äôs a plane! No! It‚Äôs Superman!
The Slavic Antithesis is used in South-Slavic epic poetry. Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, etc. It‚Äôs a fascinating literary stylistic device in which the author poses a question, gives a number of incorrect answers, and finally gives the correct answer. This increases the validity as well as the impact of the last answer.
An Example ‚Äú≈†ta se bijeli u gori zelenoj?</description>

      <description>If you know me, you know I‚Äôm a huge fan of Dragonball. Be it the original, Dragonball Z, Dragonball GT (yes, I said it!), or DragonBall Super. I have been thinking a lot about my life and how I got where I am today. The thing that always comes back is the Goku effect.
What is the Goku effect? Quite simply‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalways work as hard as you can to be the best.</description>

      <title>On Scala Case Classes and Companion Objects</title>

      <description>Structuring your code in terms of case classes and companion objects is a great way to easily decouple your data and allow people to easily use it.
Here‚Äôs an example of where case classes are incredibly useful. Let‚Äôs say we want to solve an algorithm question. Knowing how this algorithm works isn‚Äôt really necessary to understand the concepts of this blog post but I just wanted to show how the abstraction works.</description>

      <title>Functional Error Handling in Scala</title>

      <description>For this blog post, I am going to be using a strongly typed language‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäScala. All the principles here apply to any other strongly typed functional programming language.
There are several reasons why throwing errors is bad. The biggest one is that it‚Äôs a GOTO. It makes your code difficult to reason about and control.
So‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow do we approach errors in a more functional way? We know we can‚Äôt just do the following:</description>

      <description>I went to an art workshop last week. It was hosted by an Austrian artist couple who call themselves UBERMORGEN. If I never knew anything about them, or if I never heard of their art, I would think that they were hackers making cool side projects for fun. I would never view them as artists. Look at their projects and tell me they wouldn‚Äôt win 1st place at any hackathon with those ideas.</description>
